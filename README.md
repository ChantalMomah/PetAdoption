# PetAdoption
Pet Haven – Frontend Web Project
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
• What Was Created: A responsive pet adoption website for a fictional shelter, showcasing available pets, service information, and a simple adoption request form.
• Results: Improved user interaction with a soft, welcoming aesthetic and a user-friendly form, encouraging visitors to explore adoption options.
• Problem Solved: Addressed the need for a clear and attractive platform to promote animal adoption and make the inquiry process more accessible.
• How: Built a multi-section layout styled with a cute purple-themed CSS design and enhanced interactivity using vanilla JavaScript for form validation and submission feedback.
